// Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
// An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

// Approach: Simple DFS but instead of making use of visited vector, we can simply make grid[i][j] = '0' after visiting it
